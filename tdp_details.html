										<h1>Collaborative Discussion one</h1>
									</header>
									
									<p>My initial Post focused much on the future of data scientists, and I argued that the continuous advancement in technology will not only deepen the complexity of the roles of data scientists but also threaten to automate them (Vaast and Pinsonneault, 2021). However, I was of the view that the nature of data scientists' roles will make them persist in future and data scientists need to adapt to changes by advancing their skills.</p>
									<p>From the peer responses on the future of data scientists, I explored more on the sector's specific fate. I discovered all sectors will be affected by technological advancement in one way or the other. Additionally, apart from replacing jobs in future, technological advancement will also create new jobs and complement existing ones (Fey 2015; Selenko 2022). Thus, more future opportunities for data scientists.</p>
									<p>My other argument was against the viewpoint that the ambiguity surrounding the roles of data scientists will make them obsolete in future (Vaast and Pinsonneault 2021). Taking a deeper dive into the roles of data scientists and the peer responses, I learnt that data management, cleaning, analysis, integrity checks, interpretation and alignment with business goals constitute the key role of data scientists in an organization (Fayyad and Hamutcu, 2022). However, I discovered that data scientists' roles are generalized and often misunderstood (Fayyad and Hamutcu, 2022; Nelson and Irwin, 2013). Therefore, more research is needed on the relevant roles of a data scientist, and data scientist needs to specialise in specific roles in future.</p>
									<p>One peer response pin-pointed the emphasis on ethical issues. I explored that data scientists need to pay attention to privacy and ethical considerations throughout the data management lifecycle (Wing, 2019). Further, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) stipulates recommended and legal principles that guide the treatment of personal data. Thus, the data life cycle phases should be influenced by the integration of the following GDPR key principles: purpose limitation, data minimization, accuracy, and storage limitation. Integrity, confidentiality and security, and accountability (Zaeem and Barber, 2020).</p>
									<p>In conclusion, from the discussion and the topics covered, I have understood the roles of data scientists, the integration of ethical issues in the data management life cycle, master data management and the future of data scientists.</p>

								<h1>Collaborative discussion two</h1>
							</header>
							<p>A Reflection on the focus of the discussion revealed much about the Global Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which is the regulatory framework that guides the collection and processing of personal data for citizens or residents of the European Union disregarding data collectors' or processors' location (Kuner, 2020; Suripeddi and Purandare, 2021). Thus, GDPR imposes a guide that data collection and processing must be lawful, fair, transparent, legitimate and limited to the purpose; data must be kept securely, accurately and up to date, and storage must be limited to its purpose; and the data collectors and processors must be accountable for the compliance of GDPR (Zaeem and Barber, 2020).</p>
							<p>My analysis centred on data safeguards issues in a setting where explicit Data Privacy and Protection laws are non-existent. The first peer responses by Richard, Nima and Simbiso focused on Master Data Management (MDM) as a mechanism for achieving data privacy and protection. The discussion highlighted that all elements within MDM would be of benefit to an organisation which is running multiple subsystems. According to Assefa (2018), effective MDM will enable centric data management, collection of relevant data elements by the purpose, and secure storage with adequate procedures and safeguards on modification, retention, deletion and access.</p>
							<p>The second part of the discussion focused on the Data Privacy and Protection Bill which has yet to be enacted by Malawi. My colleague, Nima, highlighted the flaws within the policy. A reflection on this has revealed that even though the drafting of data protection legislation has shown progress towards improving data protection in Malawi, there is a need for further review of some elements within the draft for its effectiveness. Reflection on Chiziamoku’s comment revealed that data protection laws will lead to some improvement in data privacy in Malawi. However, the change might take time due to some existence of barriers to the understanding of privacy by residents (Kainja and CIPESA, 2018; Nyemba, 2018).</p>
							<p>In conclusion, compliance with data privacy and protection laws requires an enabling environment where there are explicit data privacy laws. Further, data privacy and protection is an administrative, technical and technological issue within an organisation.</p>

                                <h1>Data Analytics Report – Data Processing Pipeline and Evaluation</h1>
                            </header>

                            <p>The data analytical report outlined the plans for data processing and analysis to evaluate the transport system in Wales given dataset from the Walsh National Survey on Transport conducted between April 2013 and March 2014. The survey had a sample size of 4,600 respondents from various locations in Wales.</p>
<p>The Wales National Survey dataset provided estimates on various data elements and topics, including the overall satisfaction with the state of Wales’s transport system.</p>
<p>My approach focused on the relevant data tables from the given array of tables in the dataset. Thus, the main objective was to provide a methodical approach that would utilise the data in the tables to critically explore the level of satisfaction by the citizens with the state transport system in Wales and how it is affected by different factors. The approach proposed the selection of tables with the socioeconomic characteristics of the transport users because they have an important influence on the selection and use of a transport type (Sun et al., 2019).</p> 
<p>Further, the report illustrated the relationship among the selected tables to be used using the Unified Modelling Language (UML) diagram. Additionally, the approach proposed the use of descriptive statistics to explore the association between variables against the overall satisfaction with the transport system state in Wales.</p> 
<p>Python was to be used because of its dynamicity and diversity through its large library with modules that enable effective data analysis and visualisation. Specifically, NumPy, Pandas and Openpyxl were used to import, handle, clean (selected cells) and analyse the data given in Microsoft Excel format. Additionally, the Matplotlib, Seaborn and Plotly libraries were to be used for creating charts to display comparisons, distributions, and proportions. The report also proposed the use of ArcGIS to provide a geospatial analysis given the names of locations of travellers in Wales.</p> 
<p>The dataset provided had pre-analysed estimates of the selected variables from a National Survey for Wales. These estimates were seen to restrict the depth of analysis to be used. Thus, descriptive statistics was more applicable than a more robust analysis (such as regressions).</p>
<p>In conclusion, the data analytic report submitted proposed the approach to be used for evaluating the transport system in Wales using descriptive statistics and data visualisations
